# Use Case 1: Remote Work Solution
## Background:
Contoso has 50 employees working remotely. They need a way to provide secure access to corporate applications without requiring employees to have high-end hardware.
## Use Case Objective:
Design and implement a solution that provides secure and cost-effective access to virtual desktops for employees working from different locations. The solution must be scalable.
## Design and Architecture:
- Virtual Desktop Environment: Set up an environment where employees can access their applications securely from any device. Ensure that the virtual desktop is scalable based on user demand.
- Cost Control: Use virtual desktop configurations that maximize resource efficiency without compromising performance.
- Security: Implement identity management to ensure that only authorized employees can access the environment. Ensure that data in the virtual desktops is protected.
- Scalability: Ensure that the solution can scale up or down based on usage.
## Implementation:
- Set up a virtual desktop environment that allows employees to connect remotely.
- Configure the environment to scale based on active users.
- Implement secure access controls to protect the desktops and sensitive data.
- Ensure the solution fits within the $50 monthly budget, optimizing the use of resources.
